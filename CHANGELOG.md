# Changelog

All notable changes to BVID-FE are documented in this file.

## [0.2.0-dev] - unreleased

In-progress work toward v0.2.0. No tag yet.

### Fixed

- **fe3d buckling silent fallbacks now surfaced via `AnalysisResults.notes`.**
  Previously, `fe3d_cai_buckling()` returned `(sigma_pristine_MPa, 0.0)` when
  the eigensolver found no positive eigenvalue or raised an exception, and
  `BvidAnalysis.run()` silently used FPF instead when the buckling result was
  below 5% of pristine ("plausibility gate"). The user saw `knockdown = 1.0`
  in the no-eigenvalue case and had no way to know that the buckling solve
  had quietly given up. `AnalysisResults` gains a `notes: list[str]` field
  populated by the analysis backends; `fe3d_cai_buckling()` now returns
  `(sigma, lambda_crit, notes)` so the caller can merge solver diagnostics
  into the result. The GUI Summary tab appends these notes (prefixed with
  ⚠) under the existing "--- Notes ---" section, and `AnalysisResults.summary()`
  / `to_dict()` include them in the text and JSON output. Two new tests
  in `tests/analysis/test_fe3d_buckling.py` cover the eigensolver-failure
  path end-to-end via `monkeypatch`.

- **fe3d damage factor now applied component-wise to the elasticity matrix.**
  The previous `DAMAGE_STIFFNESS_FACTOR = 0.30` was scaled into every entry of
  the 6×6 `_C_global` matrix in `analysis/fe_tier._build_elements`, uniformly
  reducing in-plane stiffness (E11, E22, G12) by 70% in delaminated zones —
  even though the docstring in `fe_mesh.py` already noted that "the plies
  themselves are intact (so in-plane load-carrying is mostly preserved)". The
  fix replaces the single constant with two physically-motivated factors:
  - `DAMAGE_OOP_FACTOR = 0.05` — out-of-plane (E33, G13, G23, and the
    in-plane / OOP Poisson cross-coupling), applied to every element inside a
    delamination ellipse footprint. Representative of the post-delamination
    interlaminar-modulus loss reported in Bolotin (2001) and Sun & Tao (1998).
  - `DAMAGE_FIBER_BREAK_INPLANE_FACTOR = 0.30` — in-plane sub-block (rows/cols
    {0, 1, 5} in the global Voigt frame), applied only inside the fiber-break
    core (within `fiber_break_radius_mm` of any delamination centroid).
    Representative of fiber-direction damage saturation in Camanho & Davila
    (2007) / Maimi et al. (2007) for CFRP.

  `FeMesh` gains a new `in_plane_damage_factors` array; existing
  `damage_factors` is now the OOP factor exclusively. The viz layer
  (stress-field heatmap, pyvista damage overlay) is unchanged because it
  visualises the OOP factor as "delamination depth", which is the right
  semantic. The fe3d Kg assembly now scales the uniaxial sigma_xx prestress
  by the in-plane factor (since the prestress is an in-plane component); pure
  delamination zones therefore carry full uniaxial load through the fibers.

  Effect on results: knockdown values shift, the buckling solve becomes more
  responsive to damage size (because the pure-delamination in-plane block is
  no longer over-penalised), and the previously-flagged "fe3d knockdown
  approximately flat vs. impact energy" caveat is partially attenuated.
  Existing tests are structural (inequalities and bounds, not pinned numeric
  values) and should still pass; CI will flag any that need updating.

### Added

- **Input-variable sensitivity rollup.** Before this change, four of the
  five impact-event inputs were silently ignored by the physics pipeline:
  - `panel.boundary` (simply_supported / clamped / free) never moved the
    Olsson bending stiffness, the semi-analytical sublaminate buckling
    coefficient, or the fe3d buckling BCs — all three tiers hard-coded
    simply-supported. Fixed by adding boundary-dependent multipliers
    (clamped=2.5× bending, 1.9× buckling; free=0.4× bending, 0.5× buckling
    per Timoshenko) in `impact/olsson.py` and `analysis/semi_analytical.py`,
    plus boundary-aware lateral-edge `u_z` penalty BCs in
    `analysis/fe_tier.py::fe3d_cai_buckling`.
  - `impactor.shape` (hemispherical / flat / conical) was never referenced
    by any physics code. Fixed by wiring shape into a per-shape Hertz-
    contact stiffness (Johnson, *Contact Mechanics* §3.4-3.5) and into a
    footprint-spread multiplier on the target DPA (flat=1.4×, conical=0.7×).
  - `impact.mass_kg` was never referenced. Fixed by adding a
    calibration-aware dynamic amplification factor `(5.5/m)^0.1`, exactly
    unity at the ASTM D7136 reference mass, plus a UserWarning when the
    impactor mass ratio falls below Olsson's quasi-static validity regime.
  - `impactor.diameter_mm` only shifted E_onset by <0.5% and was masked
    by the DPA cap; fixed by adding a `(16/d)^0.3` spread factor on DPA.

  A new scripted validation matrix (`scripts/validate_inputs.py`) runs 5
  levels of each variable across every (tier, loading) combination and
  flags any input that produces zero knockdown variation — the flags
  section now reports "(none)" for the first time.

- **Impact-location and fiber-break core markers on the damage map.**
  Previously the damage-map plot drew only the delamination ellipses, so
  a user could not tell from the plot WHERE the impact landed on the
  panel — a real problem for off-center impacts where the footprint
  asymmetry drives failure. `plot_damage_map` now adds a black "×"
  marker at each unique ellipse centroid (the impact point) and, when
  the material has a non-trivial fiber-break model (`fiber_break_eta > 0`
  and `E_impact` above the fiber-break threshold), a red filled circle
  showing the fiber-break core radius. Both appear in the legend. 4
  new regression tests in `tests/viz/test_damage_map_markers.py`.

- **Live DPA preview with saturation warning.** A new `DPA:` label in the
  Impact panel updates every time any input changes, showing both the
  absolute predicted damage area in mm² and the percentage of panel area.
  When the 80% cap engages the label switches to red bold text with a ⚠
  SATURATED marker — users now see saturation *before* pressing Run,
  rather than discovering it post-hoc via the Summary tab notice and
  wondering why knockdown stopped responding to energy. Saturation in
  the default 150×100 mm 8-ply configuration kicks in at ~15 J; this
  preview makes that limitation obvious. 4 new regression tests in
  `tests/gui/test_live_onset.py`.

- **Live E_onset preview in the Impact panel.** The `ImpactPanel.set_onset_energy()`
  method has existed since the first release but was never wired up — the
  "E_onset: — J" label stayed blank no matter what the user changed. Now
  the `BvidMainWindow` connects `configChanged` on the material, panel,
  impact, and input-mode panels to a single `_update_live_onset` slot
  that recomputes the Olsson threshold and updates the label in real
  time. Because E_onset is boundary- and shape-aware (new in this
  release), the label now responds visibly to every relevant input:
  simply_supported→clamped drops it from 0.60 J to 0.24 J, simply_supported→free
  raises it to 1.49 J, etc. Handles invalid intermediate states (user
  mid-edit) gracefully and blanks out in damage-driven mode where the
  preview is not applicable. 5 new regression tests in
  `tests/gui/test_live_onset.py`.

- **fe3d KD-vs-energy monotonicity fix.** `DAMAGE_STIFFNESS_FACTOR` in
  `analysis/fe_mesh.py` was raised from `1e-4` to `0.30`. The old value
  was physically unrealistic — it treated delaminated elements as
  essentially null in the stress field, which made the failure-index
  criterion unable to flag damaged regions, and the fe3d residual
  strength *increased* with impact energy past ~15% panel damage
  (because the peak stress in the undamaged shell drops as the damage
  footprint spreads wider). The new value represents typical residual
  in-plane stiffness after delamination (plies are intact, only the
  through-thickness coupling is lost); literature range for CFRP is
  0.1-0.5. Knockdown now trends monotonically with energy across
  simply-supported, clamped, and free boundaries (see
  `tests/test_input_sensitivity.py::test_fe3d_knockdown_mostly_decreases_with_energy`).

- **Summary tab edge-case notices.** The GUI Summary tab now surfaces
  the `UserWarning`s that previously only appeared on stderr: DPA
  saturation (knockdown insensitive to further energy), 'free' boundary
  soft-support approximation, small-mass quasi-static regime violation,
  and the known fe3d energy-insensitivity limitation. Each notice is
  one plain-language paragraph under a "--- Notes ---" section so the
  user sees why their result may not respond to an input they changed.

- **True linear buckling eigensolve in the `fe3d` CAI tier**
  `Hex8Element.geometric_stiffness_matrix(sigma_bar)` integrates
  `gradN.T @ S @ gradN` over the element via 2×2×2 Gauss quadrature and
  expands to a 24×24 K_g via `np.kron`. A new `fe3d_cai_buckling()` in
  `analysis/fe_tier.py` assembles K and K_g under a uniform uniaxial
  pre-stress (scaled by per-element damage factor), applies rigid-body
  penalty BCs, and solves `K·φ = λ·K_g·φ` via `eigsh` shift-invert.
  `BvidAnalysis.run()` for `tier="fe3d"` now returns the minimum of the
  buckling stress and the first-ply-failure stress, capturing whichever
  mode governs. `AnalysisResults.buckling_eigenvalues` is populated with
  the smallest positive eigenvalue. First-ply-failure is retained as
  `_fe3d_cai_first_ply_failure` — together they give engineers an upper
  bound (FPF) and a lower bound (buckling) on the residual strength.
- **"Damage View" GUI tab** (originally planned as "3D Mesh"). After
  three VTK embedding approaches (QtInteractor, lazy-init QtInteractor,
  BackgroundPlotter) all deadlocked Qt's main event loop on macOS, the
  tab was reworked to a matplotlib-based four-panel orthographic view:
  top (x-y), side (x-z), front (y-z), and a text summary panel. Renders
  in ~50 ms on the main thread, no OpenGL dependency. True VTK 3D
  visualization remains available via the `bvidfe.viz.plots_3d` Python
  API and the `examples/` scripts, just not embedded inside the GUI's
  event loop.
- **Validation harness** (`validation/validate_bvid_public.py`):
  `DatasetCase` dataclass + `run_dataset()` + MAE% metric. Auto-discovers
  any JSON dataset in `validation/datasets/`. Ships with a synthetic
  self-check dataset (MAE ≈ 0% by construction) so the harness is
  exercised in CI; real published datasets (Soutis, Caprino,
  Sanchez-Saez, NASA round-robin) remain to be digitized by hand.
- **CI regression gate** — new `validation` job in
  `.github/workflows/tests.yml` running
  `python validation/validate_bvid_public.py --gate`.
- **Auto-populated Knockdown Curve tab.** Every single-run analysis now
  kicks off an empirical-tier energy sweep in the background (8 points,
  sub-second) so the Knockdown Curve tab always shows a
  knockdown-vs-energy plot for context, without requiring the user to
  click "Run energy sweep" explicitly.
- **Buckling Eigenvalues tab** (was "Buckling Mode" placeholder): bar
  chart of the first up to 6 buckling eigenvalues for semi_analytical
  and fe3d runs; explanatory note for the empirical tier (no eigensolve).
- **Damage Severity tab** (was "Stress Field" placeholder): top-down
  heatmap showing how many interfaces are delaminated at each (x, y)
  column — through-thickness sum of `(1 - damage_factor)`, colored
  hot. Analogous to a C-scan plan view.
- **Stage-by-stage logging**: new `bvidfe.fe3d` and `bvidfe.gui` loggers
  write to stderr so users launching the app from a terminal see mesh
  build, K/Kg assembly, eigensolve, FPF, and heartbeat progress lines
  in real time. Controlled via `BVIDFE_LOG_LEVEL` env var.
- **Mesh-size guard** (`FE3DSizeError` + GUI dialog): both single-run
  and sweep paths check the fe3d problem size against
  `BVIDFE_FE3D_MAX_DOF` (default 500k). Hard stop above cap, soft
  warning for merely-large sizes. Prevents SIGSEGV from scipy's sparse
  solvers when memory is exhausted.
- **Heartbeat progress** in both workers: AnalysisWorker ticks every
  2 s during long fe3d runs, SweepWorker ticks per-energy. Prevents
  the status bar looking frozen during multi-minute runs.
- **Vectorized assembler + analytic FPF** in the fe3d tier: 6.5x
  speedup on realistic 5k-element meshes by (a) replacing the 24×24
  Python loop per element with one numpy broadcast, and (b) replacing
  the 12-iteration bisection for first-ply-failure with a single FE
  solve + closed-form quadratic root (Tsai-Wu and LaRC05 are both
  quadratic in stress and stress scales linearly with applied strain).
- **Sanity-check on buckling eigenvalue**: `fe3d_cai` falls back to
  FPF-only when the uniform-pre-stress buckling approximation returns
  a critical stress below 5% of pristine (indicates a numerical
  artefact on the simplified BC set).
- **Conservative defaults + inline fe3d caveat**: `MeshParams` defaults
  to 1 element/ply + 5 mm in-plane (from 4/1.0), and the Summary tab
  appends a note when `tier=fe3d` explaining that fe3d knockdown is
  largely flat vs. impact energy on the current simplified model and
  pointing users to empirical/semi_analytical for energy-dependent
  curves.
- **DPA cap + dent cap**: `impact_to_damage` clips DPA at 80% of panel
  area (emits `UserWarning`) and `dent_depth_mm` clips dent at 50% of
  laminate thickness. Prevents physically-absurd outputs like a 16 mm
  dent on a 1.2 mm laminate.
- **Four runnable examples** (`examples/01_empirical_quick.py` through
  `04_inspection_driven.py`) + `sample_cscan.json`: copy-paste workflows
  for single-run, tier comparison, energy sweep, and damage-driven
  analysis. Each writes outputs to `examples/output/`.
- **14 edge-case robustness tests** (`tests/test_edge_cases.py`): below-
  threshold energies, huge-energy DPA saturation, tiny panels, empty
  damage states, mixed tier switching, CLI end-to-end subprocess, and
  parametric monotonicity across 4 energies.
- **216 tests now passing** (was 179 at v0.1.0 — +37 new tests across
  analysis, elements, solver, GUI, CLI, and edge cases).

### Known limitations (still deferred)

- Material calibration constants remain placeholders until real datasets
  land.
- `fe3d` tier still uses stiffness-reduction at delaminations rather than
  zero-thickness cohesive surfaces (different physics — stiffness
  reduction captures the stiffness loss but not the debonding/sliding).
- **`fe3d` knockdown is approximately flat vs. impact energy** for any
  damage above the Olsson threshold. This is a structural limitation of
  the stiffness-reduction + uniform-pre-stress buckling simplifications:
  the stress-concentration-driven first-ply-failure strain is controlled
  by the healthy/damaged *boundary* rather than the damage magnitude,
  and the buckling eigenvalue is not reliably physical on our simplified
  BCs so it usually gets rejected by the 5%-pristine sanity check. An
  attempt at v0.2.0-dev to add graded damage + real in-plane pre-stress
  BCs to fix this was shelved: the proper-BC buckling eigensolve was
  14× low vs. analytical plate buckling (sign-convention / stress-field
  interpretation issues that need more time than a single session).
  For energy-dependent residual strength use `tier=empirical` (Soutis
  scales with DPA) or `tier=semi_analytical` (Rayleigh-Ritz sublaminate
  buckling scales with ellipse size). Fixing fe3d is v0.3.0 scope.
- Release artifacts are still unsigned.

### Remaining limitations (deferred to v0.2.0)

- Material calibration constants are still placeholders pending validation against published CAI/TAI datasets (Soutis, Caprino, Sanchez-Saez, NASA round-robin)
- `fe3d` tier uses stiffness reduction + first-ply-failure; true cohesive surfaces and buckling-based CAI eigensolve are deferred
- 3D Mesh / Buckling / Stress GUI tabs are placeholder widgets (2D plots are fully wired)
- Release artifacts are **unsigned** (no Apple Developer ID or Windows signing cert configured); macOS users may need `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine BVID-FE.app`

- `fe3d` CAI uses first-ply-failure on the damaged mesh, not a buckling eigenvalue solve
- No validated datasets yet (Soutis, Caprino, Sanchez-Saez, NASA digitization pending)
- PyInstaller standalone packaging not yet built
